  /// For a sharded cluster, "available" read concern provides greater
  /// tolerance for partitions since it does not wait to ensure consistency
  /// guarantees. That is, read concern "available" does not contact the
  /// shard’s primary nor the config servers for updated metadata.
  /// However, this means that a query with "available" read concern may
  /// return orphaned documents if the shard is undergoing chunk migrations.
  /// For unsharded collections (including collections in a standalone

  /// data from its in-memory view of the data at the majority-commit
  /// point. As such, read concern "majority" is comparable in performance
  /// cost to other read concerns.
  /// ##Availability:
  /// Read concern "majority" is available for use with or without causally
  /// consistent sessions and transactions.
  ///
  /// You can disable read concern "majority" for a deployment with a
  /// three-member primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture;
  /// however, this has implications for change streams

  /// replica sets must use WiredTiger storage engine.
  /// ## Note
  /// For operations in multi-document transactions, read concern "majority" provides its guarantees only if the transaction commits with write concern “majority”. Otherwise, the "majority" read concern provides no guarantees about the data read in transactions.

  /// If a majority of your replica set members crash and restart after
  /// the read operation, documents returned by the read operation are durable
  /// if writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault is set to the default state of true.
  /// With writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault set to false, MongoDB does
  /// not wait for w: "majority" writes to be written to the on-disk journal
  /// before acknowledging the writes. As such, majority write operations
  /// could possibly roll back in the event of a transient loss
  /// (e.g. crash and restart) of a majority of nodes in a given replica set.
  /// ##Availability:
  /// Read concern "linearizable" is unavailable for use with causally
  /// consistent sessions and transactions.
  ///  You can specify linearizable read concern for read operations on

  /// You cannot use the $out or the $merge stage in conjunction with read

  /// concern for db.collection.aggregate(), you cannot include either
  /// stages in the pipeline.
  /// **Requirements**: Linearizable read concern guarantees only apply if
  /// read operations specify a query filter that uniquely identifies a
  /// single document.
  /// ##Tip
  /// Always use maxTimeMS with linearizable read concern in case a majority
  /// of data bearing members are unavailable. maxTimeMS ensures that the
  /// operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures that the
  /// operation returns an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.
