/// killCursors command.
///
/// Kills the specified cursor or cursors for a collection.
/// MongoDB drivers use the killCursors command as part of the
/// client-side cursor implementation.
/// **Note**
/// In general, applications should not use the killCursors command
/// directly.
/// The killCursors command must be run against the database of the
/// collection whose cursors you wish to kill.
///
/// The command accepts the following fields:
/// * collection 	[MongoCollection]
///   - The collection over which the cursor is operating.
/// * cursorIds `List<int>`
///   -	The cursor ids list to be closed.
/// * killCursorsOptions [KillCursorsOptions] - Optional
///   - a set of optional values for the command
///
/// A driver MAY omit a session ID in killCursors commands for two reasons.
/// First, killCursors is only ever sent to a particular server,
/// so operation teams wouldn't need the lsid for cluster-wide killOp.
/// An admin can manually kill the op with its operation id in the case that
/// it is slow. Secondly, some drivers have a background cursor reaper to
/// kill cursors that aren't exhausted and closed. Due to GC semantics,
/// it can't use the same lsid for killCursors as was used for a cursor's
/// find and getMore, so there's no point in using any lsid at all.
